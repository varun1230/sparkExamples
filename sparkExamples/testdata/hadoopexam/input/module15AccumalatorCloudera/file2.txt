Description
Sqoop supports incremental loads of a single table or a free form SQL query as well as saved jobs which can be run multiple times to import updates made to a database since the last import. Imports can also be used to populate tables in Hive or HBase.[2] Exports can be used to put data from Hadoop into a relational database. Sqoop got the name from "SQL-to-Hadoop".[3] Sqoop became a top-level Apache project in March 2012.[4]

Informatica provides a Sqoop-based connector from version 10.1. Pentaho provides open-source Sqoop based connector steps, Sqoop Import[5] and Sqoop Export,[6] in their ETL suite Pentaho Data Integration since version 4.5 of the software.[7] Microsoft uses a Sqoop-based connector to help transfer data from Microsoft SQL Server databases to Hadoop.[8] Couchbase, Inc. also provides a Couchbase Server-Hadoop connector by means of Sqoop.[9]
