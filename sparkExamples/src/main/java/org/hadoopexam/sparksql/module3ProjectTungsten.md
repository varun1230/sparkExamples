Project Tungsten 

1) Purpose of Project Tungsten

It is used for modern hardware efficienct for better performance. 

Mainly used by the Dataset

Below are the benefits of using project Tungsten 
 
 a) Binary Processing 
 	All the operations are done in binary format. In java data is deserialized for comparison where as in Spark(scala) data is converted in binary formated and handles the sorting and filtering process
 	
 
 b) Cache Aware Computation
 	
 
 c) Code Generation
 	Code generation happens once and applies on all the data.
 	
 d) Custom Memory management 
 	Instead of using java memory mamanegment tungsten using its own memory managment for high  performance
